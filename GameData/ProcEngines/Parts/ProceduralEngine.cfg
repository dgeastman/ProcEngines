	description = Although criticized by some due to their not insignificant use of so-called "pieces found lying about", the LV-T series engines have proven themselves as comparatively reliable. The T30 model boasts a failure and rattly bits ratio below the 50% mark, this has been considered a major improvement over previous models by engineers and LV-T enthusiasts.
